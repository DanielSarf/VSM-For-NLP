Renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydropower, are key to reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and combating climate change. Solar energy harnesses the power of the sun, while wind energy uses turbines to convert wind into electricity. Hydropower relies on the movement of water to generate power. These renewable sources are not only environmentally friendly but also increasingly cost-effective. As technology advances, renewable energy will play a larger role in creating a sustainable future for the planet.
