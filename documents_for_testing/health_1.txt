Mental health is just as important as physical health, yet it often receives less attention. Mental health issues, such as anxiety, depression, and stress, can have a profound impact on a person's overall well-being. It is essential to raise awareness about mental health, reduce stigma, and provide support for those who need it. Regular exercise, a balanced diet, and adequate sleep are all factors that contribute to maintaining good mental health. Seeking professional help when necessary is also an important step in managing mental health.
