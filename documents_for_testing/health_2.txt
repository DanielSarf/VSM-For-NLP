A healthy diet is crucial for maintaining overall well-being. Eating a variety of nutrient-rich foods helps provide the body with the vitamins, minerals, and energy it needs to function optimally. Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins should make up the foundation of a balanced diet. Avoiding excessive sugar, salt, and processed foods can help prevent chronic conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. Regular meals and hydration are also important for sustaining energy levels throughout the day.
